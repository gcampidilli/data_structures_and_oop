# data_structures_and_oop
Projects completed as part of Cornell University's CS 2110: Data Structures and Objected Oriented Programming (taken Fall 2020)


Topics include program structure and organization, object-oriented programming (classes, objects, types, sub-typing), graphical user interfaces, algorithm analysis (asymptotic complexity, big O notation), recursion, data structures (lists, trees, stacks, queues, heaps, search trees, hash tables, graphs), graph algorithms. Java is the principal programming language.

| Assigment | Key Concept(s) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A1	| Classes | Practice developing a class. <br>
| A2	| Functions	| Practice writing Java functions, mainly dealing with Strings. <br>
| A3	| Linked Lists	| Introduce you to linked lists. <br>
| A4	| Recursion on trees|	Write methods to process trees in an interesting application. <br>
|A5	|Heaps	| Implement a heap. <br>
|A6	|GUIs	|Learn about GUIs using various data structures. <br>
|A7	|Shortest path|	      Implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. <br>
|A8	|NYC Sewer system	 | Navigate the NYC sewer system to find a ring and pick up coins. Use combination of all data structures and graph algorithms covered. <br>
