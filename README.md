# data_structures_and_oop
Projects completed as part of Cornell University's CS 2110: Data Structures and Objected Oriented Programming (taken Fall 2020)


Topics include program structure and organization, object-oriented programming (classes, objects, types, sub-typing), graphical user interfaces, algorithm analysis (asymptotic complexity, big O notation), recursion, data structures (lists, trees, stacks, queues, heaps, search trees, hash tables, graphs), graph algorithms. Java is the principal programming language.

A1	Classes	            Practice developing a class. See pinned Piazza note @13 (when it becomes available)
A2	Functions	          Practice writing Java functions, mainly dealing with Strings.
A3	Linked Lists	      Introduce you to linked lists.
A4	Recursion on trees	Write methods to process trees in an interesting application.
A5	Heaps	              Implement a heap.
A6	GUIs	              Learn about GUIs using heaps.
A7	Shortest path	      Implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
A8	NYC Sewer system	  Navigate the NYC sewer system to find a ring and pick up coins. Use combination of all data structures and graph algorithms covered.
